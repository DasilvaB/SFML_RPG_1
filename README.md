SFML Roll Playing Game (RPG)

Very first RPG. 

11/4/17 - 
    Projectiles Added.
    Errors:
      - Need to take projectiles out of main loop
      - When return rect.getPosition, says its a vector2f not a float. (Conversion error).
      - Projectiles need to be set to the players position
      - Set setters/getters for needed variables (lol rip).
      - Projectiles non-stop spawning (see space bar, maybe error?).
